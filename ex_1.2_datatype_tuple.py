purpose : about tuple in python

List: A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. 
The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples 
cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.

creation: using ()

Tuple defination by python.org:
Tuples

Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous 
data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the enumerate() built-in). Tuples are also used for cases 
where an immutable sequence of homogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in 
a set or dict instance).

class tuple([iterable])

Tuples may be constructed in a number of ways:

    1. Using a pair of parentheses to denote the empty tuple: ()

    2. Using a trailing comma for a singleton tuple: a, or (a,)

    3. Separating items with commas: a, b, c or (a, b, c)

    4. Using the tuple() built-in: tuple() or tuple(iterable)
